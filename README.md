*Note: The project doesn’t currently work on Colab because Google updated its Python version, and Jukebox doesn’t like it. If you’re willing to adapt the notebook to be able to downgrade the Python version in the notebook, PRs are welcome!*

# Jukebox Web UI

This is a web UI for [Jukebox](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/), a music generation model by OpenAI.

## Installation

1. Procure a Colab with at least a Tesla T4 GPU and a high amount of RAM*

2. Create a new notebook

3. Copy and paste the content of `jukebox-webui.py`

4. Run the notebook

I strongly suggest that you read the [Getting Started](https://github.com/vzakharov/jukebox-webui/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) guide before using this app as to not get confused by what Jukebox is, how it works, and how it doesn’t.

Good luck!
